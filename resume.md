## WORK EXPERIENCE

## Backend Engineer | rokket.ai | Remote | Feb 2024 – Present

```
● Led the end-to-end development of multiple AI applications and agentic features using popular AI libraries
like Langchain, Haystack, guardrailsai, VLLM.
● Developed an AI Chatbot for a client, designed to efficiently retrieve and present database information to
users in a human-friendly format.
● Integrated Keycloak into the existing product for better identity and authorization and also integrated Google
single-sign-on.
● Updated a java spring boot API application to JDK version 17 from 8. This task gave me knowledge of Java
and Spring-Boot framework and how the data interaction is done using the Hibernate ORM library.
● Created kubernetes YAML conf files for the deployment of API services and also managed CI/CD pipeline
code in AWS CodePipeline for dev and prod container images updates.

## Backend Engineer | Auxin Security | Karachi, Pakistan | May 2022 – Jan 2024

```
● Reduced the dashboard load time by implementing asynchronous API calls using Python's Asyncio
framework. Successfully reduced overall API response time by 60% thereby improving use experience.
● Implemented automated DNS record management in AWS-Route-53 to dynamically update private IP
addresses of API servers due to autoscaling. Developed a AWS Lambda function using python, integrated
with Cloud-Watch Events to automatically handle Route-53 record updates upon EC2 instance creation and
deletion events.
● Designed and implemented an emit-event based notification system that performed notification delivery at
multiple levels: individual users, organizational groups, and system-wide broadcasts. The service utilizes
websocket to manage message distribution, to keep the users up-to-date about their account. enhancing user
engagement and communication efficiency.
● Optimized server performance by offloading blocking I/O operations (email delivery, notifications, and
WebSocket communications) to asynchronous background processes. Implemented Celery, a distributed task
queue system, to efficiently manage and orchestrate background job processing, resulting in improved main
server responsiveness and scalability.
● Designed and implemented a robust database migration workflow to streamline the deployment of schema
changes from development to production environments. Leveraged DBeaver's enterprise features for
executing and managing complex database migrations, ensuring data integrity and minimizing production
downtime. This standardized process enhanced the development team's efficiency in managing database
changes across environments.
● Implemented comprehensive application testing infrastructure using Docker containers and Postman
automation to validate system performance, functionality, and configuration integrity. Established a
systematic pre-deployment verification process that identifies potential runtime issues and

environment-specific configurations early in the development cycle, significantly reducing production
deployment risks.
